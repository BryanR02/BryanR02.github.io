        <h2><u><b>About me</b></u></h2>
        <p>
            Hello my name is Bryan Rios and I graduated from New Dorp High School
            back in 2020. I am an upper sophomore majoring in computer science with a minor in accounting. I 
            am testing out the waters with accounting in hopes of pursuing this as a degree. I am also working
            at the Amazon Fulfillment Center where I manage customer shipments and fix any issues that may arise
            and cause it to be late and in hopes of getting them out in time for the customer. Amazon is also helping
            me pay my tuition so im trying to finish my degrees as soon as possible to get started on my future. 
            I plan on going for a career in web development and just in case, a backup career in Accounting.
